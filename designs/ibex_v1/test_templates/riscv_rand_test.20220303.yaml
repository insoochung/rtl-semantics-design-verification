# Restrictions:
# 1)  +no_wfi must be 1 to prevent the core from hanging during tests.
# 2)  if +no_directed_instr is 1, any directed instruction streams specified by the
#     +stream_name_... parameters will be ignored and will not be generated.
# 3)  +no_data_page must be 0 (default) if there are any directed streams
#     involving memory loads and stores.
# 4)  The +enable_misaligned_instr parameter is only used by the riscv_jal_instr
#     directed stream, and will have no effect if this stream is disabled.
# 5)  The +enable_unaligned_load_store parameter is only used by load/store
#     directed instruction streams, and will have no effect if these streams
#     are disabled.
